# Julia linter for Vim

This plugin adds linting for Julia by using the [Neomake](https://github.com/benekastah/neomake) plugin and the [Lint.jl](https://github.com/tonyhffong/Lint.jl) Julia package.

# Installation

You should be able to install it as you would any other plugin using your preferred plugin manager (e.g. Pathogen, Vundle...). You must also have the [Neomake](https://github.com/benekastah/neomake) plugin installed, and the [Lint.jl](https://github.com/tonyhffong/Lint.jl) package in Julia.
Please make sure that you have the head version of Lint.jl (use `Pkg.clone("Lint")` instead of `Pkg.add("Lint")`).

### Pathogen
```
$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
$ git clone https://github.com/benekastah/neomake
$ git clone https://github.com/zyedidia/julialint.vim
$ julia -e 'Pkg.clone("Lint")'
```

(Use `.nvim` if you are using Neovim)

### Vundle
Add the following lines to your `.vimrc` (`.nvimrc` if using Neovim)
```
Plugin 'benekastah/neomake'
Plugin 'zyedidia/julialint.vim'
```
Then run
```
$ julia -e 'Pkg.clone("Lint")'
```

# Usage

When you run `:Neomake` Lint.jl will be run on the current file and any errors or warnings will pop up on the side of the screen. The very first time you check for errors, give the plugin some time to start up (10 seconds maybe, it has to load lint and the functions...). If you would like to see a full list of errors and warnings, you can open the location list with `:lopen` (see more information with `:h location-list`).

If you have a project with multiple files and would like to lint the top level one and not the one being currently edited, place a file called `.julialint` in the top level directory, and in the first line of that file, write the name of the top level file you would like the linter to use. The linter will search in higher directories and find the `.julialint` file.
